## CHALLENGE 1: Chinese-lazy-theorem-1

### Problem

https://github.com/adaisyx/lactf22-writeup/blob/79710f1fb0ed1984530c4094342908fa2959daed/Chinese%20Lazy%20Theorems/chinese-lazy-theorem-1.py#L6-L50


### Solution
Despite the name, there is no need for the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
The problem provides us with two variable ```p``` and ```q```, generates a hidden target ```0 <= target < p*q```. It also provides the result for ```target % input``` 
which is the modulus of the target with any given input number. Since this modulus is unbounded, we can rely on basic math:
``` a % b = a, for all values of a and b if b > a```
Thus, we enter ```input = p*q + 1``` and the code provides us with the output ``` target % input = target```.
Note here you may choose to write a script for this, but because it's very simple I just put the p and q through a large number multiplier website such as this one:

## CHALLENGE 2: Chinese-lazy-theorem-2

### Problem

https://github.com/adaisyx/lactf22-writeup/blob/79710f1fb0ed1984530c4094342908fa2959daed/Chinese%20Lazy%20Theorems/chinese-lazy-theorem-2.py#L6-L54

### Solution
This time the modulus is bounded, as ```input <= max(p, q)```. I'm afraid we'll have to learn the Chinese Remainder Theorem after all.

#### Theory
```
Given 2 coprime numbers p and q, where
x = a (mod p) and y = b (mod q)
[1] x' = xy/x and y' = xy/x
[2] z1 * x' ≡ 1 (mod x) and z2 * y' ≡ 1 (mod y)
[3] w1 ≡ z1 * x' (mod pq) and w2 ≡ z2 * y' (mod pq)

x = a*w1 + b*w2 (mod pq)
```
In our case, p and q are both prime numbers, hence they're coprime. Our target is the x stated above. We can write a script to find the solution:

### Comments
Admittedly I don't fully understand the theory. The final result ```x = value (mod pq)``` should mean that ```x % pq = value``` so I believe 
``` x = value +/- n(pq), n is an integer``` but that didn't work so I tried the hail mary seen in the code ``` x = (value % pq) +/- n(pq)```.
I'm still not sure how this worked out but... guess it did. Note also that the list of possible solutions generated by the script is not exhaustive.
Since we are only given 30 tries, I only generate 30 possible values for target, but the actual value may not be in the list generated, so the script may not work every time.
